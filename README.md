The Scientific Calculator code has multiple options for Single Variable Operations, Double Variable Operations and Matrix Operations.
In addition there is a History functionality - which will store all the previous calculations performed in a 'History.txt' file. 
The logs in the 'History.txt' file can be viewed and cleared as well.
